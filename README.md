## About The Project


> **Note:** The Braille inscription on the right side of the banner reads: *I am AI assistant*.


OptiMindAI is an innovative AI-powered assistant designed to empower blind and visually impaired individuals in their daily lives. 
The project combines advanced computer vision, voice interaction, and navigation assistance into a single, accessible platform.

### Key Features
- **Object and Scene Recognition:** Utilizes YOLOv5, MTCNN, and other computer vision models to detect and describe surroundings with high accuracy.
- **Voice Assistant:** Integrated speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities allow users to interact hands-free, ask questions, and receive spoken feedback.
- **Navigation Aid:** Provides real-time location assistance and guidance to help users navigate both indoor and outdoor environments.
- **Accessibility-First Design:** Built with a clean, intuitive interface in Tkinter, featuring large icons, Braille integration, and clear audio prompts.

### Technical Highlights
- YOLOv5 and MTCNN for computer vision
- face_recognition for facial detection and identification
- SpeechRecognition and pyttsx3 for voice input/output
- Tkinter for the graphical interface
- Optimized for Windows with optional GPU acceleration via CUDA

### Mission
OptiMindAI is not just a tool but a step toward inclusive technology, ensuring that blind and visually impaired individuals can live more independently, 
interact with their environment, and gain access to critical information effortlessly.
